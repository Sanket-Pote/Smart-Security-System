# Smart-Security-System

##Overview
The Smart Security System using a matrix keypad and solenoid lock is designed to enhance the security of restricted areas by incorporating a password-protected locking mechanism. This system uses an Arduino microcontroller to interface with a matrix keypad for password entry and a solenoid lock for physical security. Users can unlock the system by entering the correct password, providing a secure and user-friendly method of access control for homes, offices, and other secure locations.

##Components
- Arduino Board: The central microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano) that manages input from the keypad and controls the solenoid lock.
- Matrix Keypad: A keypad (typically 4x4 or 4x3) used for entering the password.
- Solenoid Lock: An electrically controlled lock that engages or disengages based on the correct password entry.
- Power Supply: Provides power to the Arduino and solenoid lock.
- LCD Display (optional): Displays messages such as "Enter Password" and "Access Granted".
- Resistors and Connectors: Various electronic components to interface and connect the keypad and solenoid lock to the Arduino.

##Benefits

- Enhanced Security: Prevents unauthorized access to secure areas, improving overall security.
= Convenience: Users can easily unlock the system with a memorable password, eliminating the need for physical keys.
- Cost-Effective: Utilizes affordable and widely available components, making it accessible for personal and small business use.
- Easy Installation: Simple wiring and programming process, allowing for quick and straightforward setup.

##Features
- Password Protection: Uses a matrix keypad for secure password entry to unlock the solenoid lock.
- Low Power Consumption: Efficient power usage suitable for battery-operated systems.
- Ease of Use: Intuitive and user-friendly interface for entering passwords and managing access.
- Can be used in doors aeroplane cockpit shops etc.
